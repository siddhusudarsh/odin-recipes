# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project’s Foundations course. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. It will consist of a main index page and a few links to individual recipe pages.

## What I’ll Demonstrate

- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub (clone, commit, push)
- Creating and organizing an HTML project
- Writing semantic HTML
- Linking multiple pages together
- Structuring a simple, clean project
